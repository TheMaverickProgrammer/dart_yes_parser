# YES Script
`YES` - **Y**our **E**xtensible **S**cript .

YES is a meta [scriptlet standard][SPEC] whose elements and meaning are determined
by **YOU** the programmer. They can be extended further with attributes which
allow **YOUR** end-users to make their additions to **YOUR** elements.

## Getting Started
The dart API provides two constructors: parsing by file or parsing by string.
These constructors require the callback function to be set via `.onComplete(...)`.

Loading by file is asynchronous and must be waited on for completion
```dart
void main() async {
  final p = YesParser.fromFile(File.fromUri(Uri.file("example.mesh")), onComplete: onComplete);

  // Wait for parser to finish before ending program
  await p.join();
}

void onComplete(List<ElementInfo> elements, List<ErrorInfo> errors) { ... }
```

Loading by string is synchronous and can be used immediately.
```dart
void main() {
  final p = YesParser.fromFile("...", onComplete: onComplete);
}

void onComplete(List<ElementInfo> elements, List<ErrorInfo> errors) { ... }
```

See the [example](./example/yes_parser_example.dart) to learn how to access
element types and their data from a [mesh file format](./example/example.mesh)
which uses the YES scriplet spec.
