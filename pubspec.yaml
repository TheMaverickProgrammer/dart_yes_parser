description: 
  Dart implementation of the YES scriplet standard.
  YES is a meta scriptlet standard whose elements and meaning are customized
  by the programmer. This library parses files using the YES spec and delivers
  the result as elements. Use the KeyVal args passed into each element to
  provide external functionality to their own software easily and quickly
  at no cost to readability or flexibility. It is a format for everyone.
